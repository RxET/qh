  title: Why Queer Healers
  description: >-
    Find highly-skilled queer healers of diverse identities, modalities, and
    backgrounds. 
description: >-
  Think body, esoteric, and ritual workers, doulas, herbalists, coaches, etc.
  Instead of sifting through years of posts on your city’s Queer Exchange group,
  or going down a hashtag rabbit hole on Instagram, browse modalities, read
  reviews, and book appointments with any queer healer worth their salt (ahem).

  heading: What we offer
  description: >
    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
