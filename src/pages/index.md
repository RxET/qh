  title: Why Queer Healers
  description: >
    Find highly-skilled queer healers of diverse identities and backgrounds
    working within a wide variety of healing practices and modalities
description: >-
  Think body, esoteric, and ritual workers, doulas, herbalists, coaches, etc.
  Instead of sifting through years of un-updated posts on your city’s Queer
  Exchange group, or going down a hashtag rabbit hole on Instagram, browse
  modalities, read reviews, and book appointments with queer healers whose
  wisdom and experience speaks to your personal needs.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
